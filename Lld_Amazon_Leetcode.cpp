/*
    Design a data structure in which you can store historical search terms and their frequency of search.
     When a user inputs a new search text (search_input), return the top K most frequent search terms that have the same prefix as search_input. 
     Also, every time there is a search being made (a search input being given) the search terms and their frequency should be updated in the trie/map. 
    (if its a new term, frequency is 1, otherwise increment the frequency of the search term)
